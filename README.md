# mono-dump

The project references Mono headers which can be acquired by installing [Mono][mono-installer]:

For the most part the project has been run against the game
[Idle Champions of the Forgotten Realms from Epic Games Store][idle-champions].

Unity games actually run a [Mono fork by Unity][mono-fork] which could be
helpful when interfacing with il2cpp compiled games instead.
